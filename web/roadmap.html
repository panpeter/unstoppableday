    <h1>Roadmap</h1>
</header>

<main>
    <h2>Phase 1 (completed)</h2>
    <p>
        The goal of phase 1 is to launch day NFTs.
    </p>
    <div class="phase_image">
        <img src="img/phase1.svg"/>
    </div>
    <p>
        All events are grouped by date and each day is represented by an ERC-721 token.
        The day owner has certain responsibility - to promote the day across their network.
        As a reward, they will keep receiving <code>UDAY</code> coins proportionally to the community engagement.
    </p>
    <p>
        Naturally, upcoming days will be more popular, so they will have a higher value. Famous past days (and also
        future ones) may be valuable too.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>The minting fee will be only $10</b>.
        Ideally, it should be free, but we need a relatively small amount to prevent abuse and promote fair
        distribution.
    </p>

    <h2>Phase 2 (current)</h2>
    <p>
        Phase 2 goal is to launch posts and <code>UDAY</code> coin.
    </p>
    <div class="phase_image">
        <img src="img/phase2.svg"/>
    </div>
    <p>
        A post will also be an NFT and everyone can create one for free. Every post will be associated with a single
        day and others can "like" or upvote posts. Authors of the most popular posts will be rewarded with
        <code>UDAY</code> coin.
    </p>
    <p>
        There will be also a few spots on the day page for "promoted" posts. The post promoter will have to acquire
        and spend <code>UDAY</code> coins which will then get <b>burned</b>. Posts burning the most <code>UDAYs</code>
        will win the place in promo spots in an auction-like manner.
    </p>
    <p>
        This will create a demand for <code>UDAY</code> and its price will be naturally settled by the market. Active
        users will be able to sell rewarded <code>UDAYs</code> and promoters will be able to use them to promote their
        posts and support <a href="https://unstoppableday.io">unstoppableday.io</a> community.
    </p>

    <h2>Phase 3</h2>
    <p>
        Phase 3 goal is to launch comments.
    </p>
    <div class="phase_image">
        <img src="img/phase3.svg"/>
    </div>
    <p>
        When completed, everyone will be able to comment and start new discussions. Similarly, as with posts, the most
        interesting content will be rewarded with <code>UDAY</code> coins by the community using the voting system.
    </p>
    <p>
        This will significantly increase the engagement of the <a href="https://unstoppableday.io">unstoppableday.io</a>
        community and trigger a conversion from an aggregator to a fully-fledged social platform.
    </p>

    <h2>Future</h2>
    <p>
        After Phase 3 <a href="https://unstoppableday.io">unstoppableday.io</a> platform should host a thriving crypto
        community. It will be a daily go-to place for everyone to check what's new in crypto and discuss the latest
        events.
    </p>
    <div class="phase_image">
        <img src="img/future.svg"/>
    </div>
    <p>
        But in the future, <a href="https://unstoppableday.io">unstoppableday.io</a> will grow and spread into other
        topics. After seeing the power of this decentralized platform, new communities will naturally form around
        other interests. It's also very likely that there will be a DAO dedicated to growing and managing the platform.
