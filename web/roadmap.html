    <h1>Roadmap</h1>
    <p>
        Below is a loose roadmap. It's split into three initial phases.
    </p>
</header>

<main>
    <h2>Phase 1 (current)</h2>
    <p>
        The goal of phase 1 is to launch day NFTs.
    </p>
    <div class="phase_image">
        <img src="img/phase1.svg"/>
    </div>
    <p>
        Each day will be represented by an ERC-721 token. The day owner will have certain responsibility - to promote
        the day across their network. As a reward, they will keep receiving <code>UDAY</code> coins accordingly to the
        community engagement.
    </p>
    <p>
        Naturally, upcoming days will be more popular so they will have a higher value. But famous past days (and also
        future ones) may be very valuable too.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>The minting fee will be only $10</b>.
        Ideally, it should be free but we need a relatively small amount to prevent abuse and promote fair
        distribution.
    </p>

    <h2>Phase 2</h2>
    <p>
        Phase 2 goal is to launch events and <code>UDAY</code> coin.
    </p>
    <div class="phase_image">
        <img src="img/phase2.svg"/>
    </div>
    <p>
        An event will also be an NFT and everyone can create one for free. Every event will be associated with a single
        day and others can "like" or upvote events. Authors of the most popular events will be rewarded with
        <code>UDAY</code> coin.
    </p>
    <p>
        There will be also a few spots on the day page for "promoted" events. The event promoter will have to acquire
        and spend <code>UDAY</code> coins which will then get <b>burned</b>. Events burning the most <code>UDAYs</code>
        will
        win the place in promo spots in an auction-like manner.
    </p>
    <p>
        This will create a demand for <code>UDAY</code> and its price will be naturally settled by the market. Active
        users will be able to sell rewarded <code>UDAYs</code> and promoters will be able to use them to promote their
        events and support <a href="https://unstoppableday.io">unstoppableday.io</a> community.
    </p>

    <h2>Phase 3</h2>
    <p>
        Phase 3 goal is to launch threads and comments.
    </p>
    <div class="phase_image">
        <img src="img/phase3.svg"/>
    </div>
    <p>
        When completed, everyone will be able to comment and start new threads. Similarly, as with events, the most
        interesting content will be rewarded with <code>UDAY</code> coins by the community using the voting system.
    </p>
    <p>
        This will significantly increase the engagement of the <a href="https://unstoppableday.io">unstoppableday.io</a>
        community and trigger a conversion from a calendar to a fully-fledged social platform.
    </p>

    <h2>Future</h2>
    <p>
        After Phase 3 <a href="https://unstoppableday.io">unstoppableday.io</a> platform should host a thriving crypto
        community. It will be a daily go-to place for everyone to check what's new in crypto and discuss the latest
        events.
    </p>
    <div class="phase_image">
        <img src="img/future.svg"/>
    </div>
    <p>
        But in the future, <a href="https://unstoppableday.io">unstoppableday.io</a> will grow and spread into other
        topics. After seeing the power of this decentralized platform, new communities will naturally form around
        other interests. It's also very likely that there will be a DAO dedicated to growing and managing the platform.
